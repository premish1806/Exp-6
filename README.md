To study and implement C++ decision making statements Loops.

## Aim:
The aim of this journal is to understand and implement basic C++ programs that demonstrate the use of loops, conditional statements, and pattern printing. These programs will help in developing fundamental programming skills and logic building.

## Software Used:
- VS code

## Theory:
In this practical, we delve into essential C++ constructs like loops and pattern printing. For <strong>loops</strong> are ideal for scenarios where the number of iterations is predetermined. They consist of an initialization, a condition check, and an increment/decrement operation, which makes them efficient for tasks like counting or iterating over a fixed range. In contrast, while loops are used when the number of iterations is unknown and should continue as long as a specified condition is true. This loop checks the condition before executing its body, making it suitable for conditions that depend on runtime variables.

The do-while loop ensures that the loop body executes at least once before the condition is evaluated, making it useful for situations like user input validation, where an action must occur at least once regardless of the initial condition. Pattern printing exercises, involving nested loops, are commonly used to develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills. By manipulating loop counters and conditions, various patterns such as triangles, squares, and pyramids can be printed, providing a practical way to understand and apply the concept of nested loops.
